<h1 class="main-hed">This is the photos page</h1>

<p>
This page is for the photos I've edited using the skills I've learned from J+D Toolkit on February 11th, which are cropping images, changing the resolution of images, changing the width and height of images to certain ratios, and changing the quality of images.

This is a group photo that was cropped to a 16:9 ratio with the Journalism + Design logo placed over the top.

This image was made using the portrait photo, the overexposed image, and the close up image. To create this photo, I used layering, repetitive copying and pasting of images, the brush tool, and the selection tool.
